# Vigenere-Cipher
The Vigen√®re cipher is an example of a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. A polyalphabetic substitution cipher is similar to a monoalphabetic substitution except that the cipher alphabet is changed periodically while enciphering the message. This makes the cipher less vulnerable to cryptanalysis using letter frequencies.
